Learning braindumps via Visual CertExam sucks. It's not comfortable,
and it doesn't hide questions you know well from you. Anki, on the other
hand does this and many other things as well, making it perfect for learning
any kind of material, not just braindumps.

This is where this script is useful. You export the exam from VCE Designer to
txt format, and then use this script to convert it to a .csv file that Anki can
import. Some time later I might add direct conversion to .anki deck.

The script is rough, but it works. The question and the answers goes to the first
field. The correct answer(s) go to the second field. If there is some
Explanation/Reference it is attached to the second field.

Fields are separated by the tilde (~) character

Open up the source, and figure out how it works. It's not that hard, and if you're
on Github you probably can easily use it and improve upon it.

That's it!

I thought this little script written in mighty Python might help someone as much
as it helped me, so here it is. I might add some features in the future, but
if you need some feature, please take your time and code it yourself.
